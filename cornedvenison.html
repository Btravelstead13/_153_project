        <p>Vension, a red meat simliar to beef or lamb, has countless prepartation options. Pot roast was one of the meals I mentioned earlier that I loved growing up, whether it was prepared by my mother or my father. For my own home, I prefer to brine the roast in advance. This process is known as "corning". The meat is submerged for several days in a liquid with aromatics and a curing salt. The result is the same flavorful, rose-colored roast served as corned beef, but lower in fat and cholesterol.</p>
