            <h2>Corned Venison Roast: A New Tradition</h2>

        </header>

        <p>Vension, a red meat simliar to beef or lamb, has countless prepartation options. Pot roast was a meal that I loved growing up, although always slightly different depending on who was responsible for the preparation. For my own home, I prefer to brine the roast in advance. This process is known as "corning". The meat is submerged for several days in a liquid with aromatics and a curing salt. The result is the same flavorful, rose-colored roast served as corned beef, but lower in fat and cholesterol.

        </p>

        <p>To prepare the corned venison roast, first make the brine. In a large pot, combine:
        </p>

            <ul>
                <li>1 gallon of water</li>
                <li>1 cup of kosher salt</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of pink curing salt (Prague Powder #1)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of pickling spice (available in most grocery stores)</li>
                <li>4 crushed garlic cloves</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
        Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the salts and sugar. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature. Submerge a 3-4 pound venison roast in the brine, cover, and refrigerate for 5-7 days. Every day, agitate the solution and flip the roast to ensure even curing. This process has the potential to be hazardous if not done properly. The entire roast must remain submerged and refrigerated while it cures.

        <p>After the brining period, remove the roast from the liquid and rinse well under cold water. Place the roast in a large pot and cover with fresh water. Add:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>2 quartered onions</li>
            <li>4 crushed garlic cloves</li>
            <li>4 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of black peppercorns</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook at 325 degrees farenheit for 4-6 hours, or until the meat is tender. Remove the roast from the liquid and let rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving.

        <p>Corned venison is fantastic served with braised cabbage and fried potatoes. It is also popular in my house hold to serve with fried eggs or on rye bread with 1000 island dressing, swiss cheese, and sour kraut. While the options are numerous, I wouldn't plan on havingleftovers.
