        <div>Some people are raised hunting and adventure into cooking as a means to utilize the products of a successful hunt. I began hunting in search of better ingredients.</div>
        <br>
        <p>I have always considered myself lucky to have been raised in a household with parents that cook. Two households, actually. My parents separated when I was very young. I grew up eating similar foods in both homes, but the preparations were different. As a teenager, I chose restaurant work as my first job. It was the first of many kitchen experiences. Years went by and what seemed to be an interest born of necessity became both a hobby and a career.

        <p>Hunting came later. I have enjoyed hiking, fishing, and shooting sports most of my life. On many occasions, fishing had brought home higher quality ingredients than what I could find (or afford) at the store. At the suggestion of several of my friends, I tried hunting for the first time in my early thirties. In time, I applied the skills and methods I had picked up in my culiinary education and from the various kitchens I have worked in to the game I brought home.

        The recipes on this site are those that have become favorites in my home over the years. They are simple, straightforward examples of what can be done with only a few extra steps. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.
